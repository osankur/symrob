Known issues
   0) Bug in parser - simulator
   -- exact model checkin of lip sync fails. debug this. This can be due to ***urgent*** channels being ignored
   -- scheduling/a.xml is also incorrect : la garde discrete n'est pas recpectee.

   1) Syntactically check whether the guards contain discrete variables
   (rather than raising run-time exceptions).
   Accordingly allow some algorithms on automata without discrete variables
