Symrob: timed automata model checker
==========
This is a prototype model checker reading a subset of Uppaal xml files
with the following features:
1) Basic zone-based model checking
2) Robust model checking algorithm of the following paper:

Ocan Sankur. Symbolic Quantitative Robustness Analysis of Timed Automata In TACAS'15 LNCS 9035, pages 484-498. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2015.

3) A counter-example guided abstraction refinement algorithm using BDDs (the CUDD library), described in the following paper:
